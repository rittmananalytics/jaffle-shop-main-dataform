      "description": "The following changes were made: Your Dataform SQLX code appears to be mostly correct. However, there are two possible issues that I see here:\n\n1. You are utilising a function `cents_to_dollars()` which might not exist in your project's `.js` files. If such a function exists in your codebase, then you can ignore this issue. If not, you might need to create an appropriate function.\n\n2. Make sure that `type: 'jaffle'` and `type: 'beverage'` in `coalesce` statement are correct. If `type` column contains different values in your data, you'd have to adjust it accordingly.\n\nHere is the corrected SQLX:\n\n```sqlx\nconfig {\n  type: \"table\"\n}\n\nwith\n\nsource as (\n\n    select * from ${ref('raw_products')}\n\n),\n\nrenamed as (\n\n    select\n\n        ----------  ids\n        sku as product_id,\n\n        ---------- text\n        name as product_name,\n        type as product_type,\n        description as product_description,\n\n\n        ---------- numerics\n        {{ cents_to_dollars('price') }} as product_price,  -- check if the required js function exists\n\n\n        ---------- booleans\n        coalesce(type = 'jaffle', false) as is_food_item, -- ensure 'jaffle' is an accurate product type\n\n        coalesce(type = 'beverage', false) as is_drink_item  -- ensure 'beverage' is an accurate product type\n\n    from source\n\n)\n\nselect * from renamed\n```\n\nEnsure your JSON configurations are correct and the definitions of these SQL queries exist in your project's sqlx files."

      "description": "The following changes were made: The Dataform SQLX code is not valid because it calls a JavaScript function `cents_to_dollars` which is not defined also you are using `DATE_TRUNC` which is not available in standard SQL. \n\nTo correct the issue, you would need to use standard SQL functions for converting cents to dollars and for truncating the date. \n\nExample corrected code would be:\n\n```sqlx\nconfig {\n  type: \"table\"\n}\n\nwith\n\nsource as (\n\n    select * from ${ref('raw_orders')}\n\n),\n\nrenamed as (\n\n    select\n\n        ----------  ids\n        id as order_id,\n        store_id as location_id,\n        customer as customer_id,\n\n        ---------- numerics\n        subtotal as subtotal_cents,\n        tax_paid as tax_paid_cents,\n        order_total as order_total_cents,\n       \n        CAST(subtotal AS DECIMAL(10,2)) / 100 as subtotal,\n        CAST(tax_paid AS DECIMAL(10,2)) / 100 as tax_paid,\n        CAST(order_total AS DECIMAL(10,2)) / 100 as order_total,\n\n        ---------- timestamps\n        strftime('%Y-%m-%d', ordered_at) as ordered_at\n\n    from source\n\n)\n\nselect * from renamed\n```\nIn this correction, `{{ cents_to_dollars('subtotal') }}`, `{{ cents_to_dollars('tax_paid') }}`, `{{ cents_to_dollars('order_total') }}`, and `DATE_TRUNC('ordered_at', 'day')` are replaced by  `CAST(subtotal AS DECIMAL(10,2)) / 100`, `CAST(tax_paid AS DECIMAL(10,2)) / 100`, `CAST(order_total AS DECIMAL(10,2)) / 100`, and `strftime('%Y-%m-%d', ordered_at)`\n\nI've replaced `cents_to_dollars` conversion with division by 100 after casting to Decimal(10,2). \n\nFor date truncation, I've used `strftime` which will get us the Date in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format, effectively truncating time.\nAlso, please ensure that the `ordered_at` is of datetime subtype. In case it's timestamp, `strftime` won't work and you need to use the appropriate function according to your SQL engine."

      "description": "The following changes were made: The provided Dataform SQLX code is almost correct. There are a few minor changes needed. The corrections are:\n\n1. Dataform uses JavaScript SQLX, so `{{ dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key(['id', 'sku']) }}` is an incorrect syntax. This function (`generate_surrogate_key`) does not exist, we would use a simple concatenation.\n2. Another issue is `{{ cents_to_dollars('cost') }}`, it's also incorrect because no function is defined in Dataform with the name `cents_to_dollars`. It seems like a utility function in dbt, so a direct conversion is assumed in the correction.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```sqlx\nconfig {\n  type: \"table\"\n}\n\nwith source as (\n    select * from ${ref('raw_supplies')}\n),\n\nrenamed as (\n    select\n        --------  ids\n        concat(cast(id as string), sku) as supply_uuid,\n        id as supply_id,\n        sku as product_id,\n\n        ---------- text\n        name as supply_name,\n\n        ---------- numerics\n        cost / 100.0 as supply_cost,\n\n        ---------- booleans\n        perishable as is_perishable_supply\n\n    from source\n)\n\nselect * from renamed\n```\n\nExplanation of changes:\n\nThe `dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key(['id', 'sku'])` expression was replaced with `concat(cast(id as string), sku)`, this effectively creates a surrogate key by concatenating` id` and `sku`.\n\nThe `{{ cents_to_dollars('cost') }}` expression was replaced with `cost / 100.0` assuming that 'cost' is given in cents and needs to be converted to dollar."

      "description": "The following changes were made: The code you provided is mostly correct, but one important thing to note is that the JavaScript function `get_base_dates()` doesn't exist in the Dataform's SQLX syntax. \n\nDataform uses JavaScript for configuration files, but SQL for transformations. This wrong function call seems like an attempt to use dbt (a similar tool to Dataform) function in Dataform project which is not possible directly.\n\nHere, you're trying to generate a series of dates. Unfortunately, Dataform doesn't support date generation directly in SQLX, but we can make use of BigQuery's `GENERATE_DATE_ARRAY` function to achieve similar results. \n\nBelow is the corrected code:\n\n```sqlx\nconfig {\n  type: \"table\"\n}\n\n-- metricflow_time_spine.sql\n\nWITH days AS (\n    -- Generates a series of dates from '2000-01-01' up to CURRENT_DATE()\n    SELECT \n        the_date AS date_day\n    FROM\n        UNNEST(GENERATE_DATE_ARRAY(DATE('2000-01-01'), CURRENT_DATE())) AS the_date       \n),\n\ncast_to_date AS (\n\n    SELECT \n        CAST(date_day AS DATE) AS date_day\n\n    FROM \n        days\n)\n\nSELECT * \nFROM \n    cast_to_date\n```\n\nIn this code, we use the `UNNEST(GENERATE_DATE_ARRAY())` function to create a table with a single column `the_date` which includes dates from '2000-01-01' up to the current date. Then this column is selected and cast as a date in the `cast_to_date` common table expression (CTE). The final `SELECT` statement queries all rows from the `cast_to_date` CTE."
