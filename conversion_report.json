      "description": "The following changes were made: Your SQLX code looks correct except for the following issue.\n\nYou are using a dataform helper function (`cents_to_dollars`) in your SQLX file. However, you have not defined this function in your code or referenced it from other files. \n\nIf the `cents_to_dollars` function is already defined elsewhere then you must export it from that file and import it in your current SQLX file. Otherwise, you should define the function in the SQLX file where you want to use it.\n\nAssuming that cents_to_dollars function divides the input by 100, here is the corrected SQLX code:\n\n```sqlx\nconfig {\n  type: \"table\"\n}\n\njs {\n  function cents_to_dollars(cents) {\n    return `cast(${cents} as float64) / 100`;\n  }\n}\n\nwith\n\nsource as (\n    select * from ${ref('raw_products')}\n),\n\nrenamed as (\n    select\n        ----------  ids\n        sku as product_id,\n\n        ---------- text\n        name as product_name,\n        type as product_type,\n        description as product_description,\n\n        ---------- numerics\n        ${cents_to_dollars('price')} as product_price,\n\n        ---------- booleans\n        coalesce(type = 'jaffle', false) as is_food_item,\n        coalesce(type = 'beverage', false) as is_drink_item\n    from source\n)\n\nselect * from renamed\n```\n\nIn the corrected version of your SQLX file, I've added the js block with the `cents_to_dollars` function to convert cents to dollars. Please keep in mind that you may need to adjust the function definition based on your needs."

But for now, let's consider it will be cast to `YYYY-MM-DD` format. Here's the corrected version:\n\n```sqlx\nconfig {\n  type: \"table\"\n}\n\n-- metricflow_time_spine.sqlx\nwith\n\ndays as (\n    select \n        dateadd('day', row_number() over (order by true) - 1, '2000-01-01') as date_day\n    from \n        generate_series(1, 365*10)\n),\n\ncast_to_date as (\n\n    select cast(format('%s', date_day) as date) as date_day\n\n    from days\n\n)\n\nselect * from cast_to_date\n```\nI corrected the syntax used to generate the dates in `days` Common Table Expression (CTE). We're using `dateadd` and `generate_series` to create a series of dates in the ISO format (`YYYY-MM-DD`). The `generate_series` function generates a set of rows that represents a set of generated days. \n\nThen, in `cast_to_date` CTE, we are casting `date_day` to date format using Dataform's `format` and `cast` functions."
